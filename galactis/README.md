# Galactis

Our identity service!

## What does it do?

Galactis handles logging in, registering an account, and validating a token. Users can create accounts and log in (to get a token) and other microservices can validate that a token they were given was for the correct account.

## How do I develop this?

Ask Brennan. I'm not going to bother writing much documentation because that will likely be a colossal waste of time.
